# living-algorithms
This project introduces a paradigm where the algorithms themselves evolve like living organisms. Rather than only tuning parameters or outputs, each algorithmâ€™s logic and structure mutate, crossover, and self-repair across generations. A population of small programs (expression trees) acts as digital organisms.
